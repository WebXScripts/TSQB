# TSQB

TSQB is my amateur project to create a fully asynchronous bot for TeamSpeak3 servers. The project is still under development and any bugs should be reported in issues. Feel free to contribute!


### Pros

  - Support for TeamSpeak events
  - Fast and safe
  - Mutli-platform (.net core)
 

### Tech

TSQB uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [TeamSpeak3QueryAPI](https://github.com/nikeee/TeamSpeak3QueryAPI) - .NET wrapper for the TeamSpeak 3 Query API
* [NLog](https://github.com/NLog/NLog) - Advanced and Structured Logging for Various .NET Platforms
* [Newtonsoft.Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json) -  popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET

### Installation

TSQB requires .NET Core 3.1.

I planned to write the installation after the official release.
